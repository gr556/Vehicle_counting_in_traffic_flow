# Traffic Flow Analysis â€” 3 Lane Vehicle Counting

## Overview
This project uses YOLOv8 for real-time vehicle detection and SORT tracking for consistent IDs to count vehicles passing through three separate lanes in a traffic video.

It generates annotated videos, CSV logs, and summary snapshots for lane-wise traffic analysis.

## Features

* Vehicle Tracking: Unique IDs with SORT tracker.
* 3-Lane Counting: Accurate lane-wise vehicle counts.
* Outputs:
   * Annotated MP4 video
   * CSV log of lane counts
   * Summary PNG snapshot
* YouTube Video Support: Direct processing from YouTube URLs.
* Cross-platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## How it works

Video Input: Reads local or YouTube video.

Vehicle Detection: YOLOv8 detects vehicles frame-by-frame.

Tracking: SORT tracker assigns unique IDs to vehicles.

Lane Assignment: Vehicles assigned to lanes based on x-coordinate.

Counting: Vehicles counted when crossing lane line.

Visualization: Draws bounding boxes, lane lines, movement arrows, and counts.

Save Outputs: Annotated video, CSV log, and summary snapshot.

## Setup
